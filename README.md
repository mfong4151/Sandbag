# Sandbag

Based on the sandbag minigame from the Super Smash Bros series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soriF9HdJsY.

The sandbag minigame has three main phases: 1) Do damage on the sandbag; 2) Launching the sandbag on the end of the count down; 3) Displaying the launch graphics, and a corresponding score based on the total distance covered. I plan to let the user chose from one of three characters, each with some variance in terms of how they do damage to the sandbag.

## Functionality & MVP

In my project, users will be able to:
•	Use a variety of attacks to damage a sandbag
•	Reset the game
•	Compete with others for high score.
•	Watch the sandbag fly
•	Select between three characters. 

In addition, this project will include:
•	Links to my Github
•	Read me
•	Instructions

## Wireframes:

•	Nav links include links to this project's Github repo, and linkedin.
•	Game controls will include start and stop. A button on the bottom right will include the ability to mute music.
•	Score display on the right, display

## Technologies, Libraries, and APIs:

•	Canvas API for rendering the game board and assets
•	Webpack for bundling the source Javascript code
•	npm to manage project dependencies
